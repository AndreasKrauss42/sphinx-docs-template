This is a sample chapter to show how a chapter should be added to the documentation.
Furthermore, it shows how to structure a document.

A chapter is represented by multiple documents which are collected in a subdirectory of ``docs/``.

The document itself has a **single title** which is marked by using an upper bar additionally to the underlining.

.. code-block:: rst

   =================
   Title Of The Page
   =================

The rest of the document is split into several sections having the same section type as the title:

Section
=======

.. code-block:: rst

   Section
   =======

Sections can be split in subsections, such as:

A subsection is created with following code-snippet:

.. code-block:: rst
